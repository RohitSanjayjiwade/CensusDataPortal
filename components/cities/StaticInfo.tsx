All places which had a municipality, a corporation, notified town area community or a cantonment board was known to fall under the category of city or UA. Also these places were chosen under the category as all of them had a population over 5000 and more than 75% of the male population was found to be engaged in non-agricultural working sectors. The basic city population in India had seen a good amount of growth due to urbanization and raised literacy levels.
